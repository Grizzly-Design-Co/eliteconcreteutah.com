## Frequently Asked Questions About Decorative Concrete
When you provide a service for a long time like we have you start to find the questions that everyone asks. We have compiled those most popular questions and provide the best answers we can. If you want to learn more about our service feel free to reach out.
### What are the benefits of a concrete overlay?
The main benefit of putting a decorative coating on your floor is durability. Unlike traditional flooring concrete provides more strength, scratch resistance and stain prevention. This alone is the perfect reason to resurface your existing floor with a thin concrete overlay. However, if that is not enough the number one selling point is you can make it just the way you want. We offer integral colors, acid stains, antiquing stains and much more. This allows us to get you the exact color, shade and pattern that you want. No other flooring options can do this!
### How long do concrete overlays last in Utah?
With our crazy weather many people think that a coating like this won't last. Many people are surprised to hear that most of the overlay’s that we have put down have been there for almost 14 years! They are extremely durable. Interior concrete can be sealed with an epoxy coating that will increase the life of the floor.
### What is the installation process?
In order to make sure that your project looks great and will last for years to come we take many steps that other contractors would never even consider. We start by prepping the concrete by repairing any spalling and cracks. We then manually grind the surface of the concrete to create a smooth level surface. We then go one step further and perform an acid wash on the concrete to change the ph level. The reason we change the ph level is so that our overlay product will chemically bond and become the surface of the concrete. The step from there will vary depending on the style of decorative concrete that you choose. After the design is done we apply a high quality sealer. Depending on the use and budget we have options from epoxy, urethane and acrylic sealers.
### What is the price of decorative concrete?
Depending on the design, color, sealer and prep required the price can vary. You can expect to pay between $2.50 to $4.00 per square foot. This makes our concrete coatings much more affordable compared to traditional flooring.
