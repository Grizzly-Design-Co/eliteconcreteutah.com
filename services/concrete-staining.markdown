## Which Concrete Stain Is Best For You?
We offer many different types of concrete stains including acid stains, dye stains and antiquing stains. This allows us to provide many colors, textures and patterns for you. These different stains work great in many different systems and styles. If you aren’t sure which system is right for you feel free to contact us and we will be happy to help.

### Acid Stain
Our acid stain reactively creates variegated, uneven and translucent coloring effects resembling that of natural stone. Elegant, distinctive and lasting, the look is ideal for exterior architectural concrete surfaces as well as interior floors and walls. Each application of acid stain is completely unique from the last, which is why the look cannot be duplicated.

Acid staining offers superior durability and abrasion resistance compared to that of conventional concrete floors coated with acrylic stains and paint which can wear off weather away quickly and delaminate.

### Antiquing Stain
Our antiquing stain is a water based product that creates variegated, uneven and translucent coloring effects resembling that of natural stone. Elegant, distinctive and lasting, the look is ideal for exterior architectural concrete surfaces as well as interior floors and walls.

This stain adds life to surfaces. Sidewalks, malls, retail floors and office complexes become alive with durable, yet imaginative, glare-reducing colors and patterns.

### Dye Stain
This stain is a concentrated, penetrating, metal complex dye that chemically colors polymer modified concrete overlays, polished concrete and conventional concrete surfaces to produce a permanent and translucent color effect.

When planning an installation of a dye stain, the coloring effect can be increased by first installing a colored base or texture coat with our concrete overlay system.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Concrete Stain
Here are some of the most common questions we get about our concrete staining service.

### Can this be used on interior and exterior concrete?
Absolutely! Wherever there is concrete we can stain it. In situations where there is a wood subfloor we are able to do a concrete overlay first. Then we can stain that too! So it works everywhere!
### Is the product safe?
We only use the highest quality products available. However, our acid stain does contain acid which leaves a stinky smell for a day or so. After curing all of our products are safe.
### How long does the process take?
This is a tough question to give an upfront answer. Depending on size, prep needed and other factors the process can take anywhere from 1 day to 3 weeks. Contact us and we can give you a timeline for your specific project.
### Is there maintenance involved with stained concrete?
Depending on the type of sealer you choose for the floor it can be a simple mop, or resealing every 24 months. If you have any questions about our sealers feel free to contact us.
### What is the average price to stain concrete?
The price is going to vary a lot from project to project. Depending on prep, the style you choose, size and more. Contact us today and we can give you a free estimate.

## Recent Reviews
“I hired the guys at Elite Concrete to come out and stain my back patio. It was pitted and cracked. They were able to repair the whole slab and put a great looking stain that matched the landscaping stones I have in the backyard. They do amazing work at a great price. They left my backyard cleaner than it was before they showed up. I highly recommend Elite Concrete.”

“We had another company polish the concrete in our basement, but we weren't happy with the color that they left behind. Elite Concrete came in and matched the picture we showed them perfectly. 5 stars!”

“I’m not sure whether to call these Elite Concrete a construction company or a group of artists. My concrete slab doesn’t even look like concrete anymore. I picked out a flagstone pattern for my patio, and expected it to look like fake flagstone. I was dead wrong. Mike hand carved a stone pattern that looks better than any expensive stones you could possibly buy. I am so happy with the service I received. I highly recommend Elite Concrete to anyone looking for concrete work.”
